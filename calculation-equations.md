# Audi RS7 Speed and Acceleration Calculation

## 1. Backward Speed Calculation

The Audi RS7 is capable of moving in reverse with a backward speed between 8 and 10 km/h. The average backward speed is 9 km/h.

To convert this to meters per second (m/s):

- 9 km/h = 9 * 1000 meters / 3600 seconds = 2.5 m/s

Thus, the backward speed is 2.5 m/s.

## 2. Acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h

The Audi RS7 can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.6 seconds. Let's calculate the acceleration in meters per second squared (m/s²).

### Known Values:

- Initial velocity (a0) = 0 km/h = 0 m/s
- Final velocity (a1) = 100 km/h = 27.78 m/s
- Time (t) = 3.6 seconds

Using the formula for acceleration:

```equation
  a = (a1 - a0) \ {t}
  ```
Substitute the values:

```equation
a = (27.78 - 0 ) / 3.6 = 7.72 m/s^2
  ```

Thus, the acceleration is **7.72 m/s²**.

## 3. Acceleration Range

Given that the backward speed is 2.5 m/s (negative direction), and the Audi RS7 can accelerate up to 7.72 m/s², the range of acceleration is:

- **Range of acceleration = (-2.5 m/s², 7.72 m/s²)**

This means the car's acceleration can range from decelerating at 2.5 m/s² while in reverse to accelerating at 7.72 m/s² when moving forward.

## 4. Maximum Speed of Audi RS6

The maximum speed of the Audi RS6 is 250 km/h. This provides an upper limit for the speed the RS6 can achieve while accelerating.

### Summary of Key Results:
- **Backward Speed (Avg):** 2.5 m/s
- **0 to 100 km/h Acceleration:** 7.72 m/s²
- **Acceleration Range:** (-2.5 m/s², 7.72 m/s²)
- **Maximum Speed of Audi RS6:** 250 km/h
