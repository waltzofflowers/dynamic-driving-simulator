Earth's Geometry and Coordinate System:

    Latitude lines are parallel to each other and run horizontally around the globe, from 0° (the Equator) to 90° North (the North Pole) and 90° South (the South Pole).

        The distance between two lines of latitude is approximately 111.32 kilometers or 111,320 meters, no matter where you are on Earth.

    Longitude lines, on the other hand, converge at the North and South Poles and are widest apart at the Equator. The distance between two lines of longitude varies depending on the latitude, and it's greatest at the Equator.

1. Longitude:

    1 degree of longitude at the Equator is about 111.32 kilometers or 111,320 meters, but this distance shrinks as you move towards the poles.

    To calculate the change in longitude, we need to account for this shrinking effect.

    The formula to calculate the change in longitude is:
    change in longitude=horizontal displacement111320×cos⁡(latitude in radians)
    change in longitude=111320×cos(latitude in radians)horizontal displacement​

        The value 111320 meters is how far 1 degree of longitude represents at the equator.

        cos⁡(latitude)cos(latitude) is used to scale that distance as you move north or south. The cosine of the latitude reduces the distance between degrees of longitude as you approach the poles. At the equator, cos⁡(0∘)=1cos(0∘)=1, meaning the distance per degree of longitude is largest, and at the poles, cos⁡(90∘)=0cos(90∘)=0, meaning degrees of longitude collapse to a point.

Example:

    At the Equator, 1 degree of longitude = 111,320 meters.

    At 40° North (let's say somewhere in the U.S.), cos⁡(40∘)≈0.766cos(40∘)≈0.766. So 1 degree of longitude would be approximately:
    111,320×0.766≈85,430 meters.
    111,320×0.766≈85,430 meters.

2. Latitude:

    Latitude is a little simpler because the distance between each degree of latitude is the same across the entire Earth. The Earth is almost spherical, so 1 degree of latitude is always about 111.32 kilometers or 111,320 meters, no matter where you are on the Earth.

So, to calculate the change in latitude, we can directly use:
change in latitude=vertical displacement111320
change in latitude=111320vertical displacement​

This is simpler because the change per degree of latitude does not depend on the position on the Earth — it's always 111,320 meters per degree.
